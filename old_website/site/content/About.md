Hello! I am Navi, a current junior electrical and computer engineer at the Olin College of Engineering. I am interested in the intersection of business and electrical systems design. 

I have experience in schematic capture, PCB layout design, writing firmware, digital logic design in Verilog, and ADC systems design - and hoping to gain more experience in silicon design and wireless communications. 

Satellites and communication systems are really awesome - so I joined a research lab at Olin College to help build an open source EPFD model for NGSO satellites to help verify interference metrics! :)
