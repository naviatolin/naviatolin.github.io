With the rising popularity of lifestyle video games and lack of game consoles on the market during this pandemic, I created a USB powered game controller that could interface with the popular game: Stardew Valley. This project was made as a part of a project-based microcontrollers class offered in the fall of 2020. This was a semester long class where I exercised and grew my skills in KiCAD to iteratively design schematics, layout PCBs, electrical and firmware system design, and part sourcing. This project was done across 2 months.
