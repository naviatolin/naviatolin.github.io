As a part of a principles of engineering class, I built a small, personable robot that wandered the halls of Olin College's academic center and said hi to people. This was done as a part of a 4 person team over half a semester. My personal contributions were firmware, and programming how the robot would react to its surroundings. I also used agile scrum to plan out the project and built the final documentation website.
