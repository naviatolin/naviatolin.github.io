Many college students and people in the workforce are pushing themselves in this never ending rat race which can be a huge detriment to their mental health. Olin likes to use the term "overscoping your life" to describe this phenomenon. This application aims to help people avoid this by  using the premise that people are actually more likely to be productive when they take breaks and complete activities that make themselves happy. This is backed by numerous productivity studies.

The functionality this app holds:
- a personalized planner to input calendar events and tasks
- breaks down tasks (given an estimated time) into manegeable chunks
- automated scheduling of work periods into your work day
- no scheduling of work during desired rest periods
- scheduled breaks in between work periods and events
- prioritization of self-care activities when necessary
- in the future: take user input to modify work period lengths and suggest necessary self care activities from user data

This was completed as a part of a two person team for a software design class. My contributions to the project was the algorithm writing and backend programming for the application. My partner's contributions were the front end programming and UI development.
