Hello! I am Navi, a current junior at the Olin College of Engineering. I am pursuing a degree in EECS with a focus in design aspiring to be a product design engineer. 

I enjoy working on projects that involve both software and hardware and have a specific interest in writing software for hardware (firmware). I am particularly excited about building mission driven software tools, particularly in the organizational and mental health area like notion and headspace. I also really enjoy conducting user research in order to better develop and design products.

I like working in mission driven teams that are really excited about what they are building. 

A few of my personal hobbies: 
- Piano
- Art
- Hiking
- Yoga
- Meditation
- Coffee
- Boba
- Playing around with different business ideas
