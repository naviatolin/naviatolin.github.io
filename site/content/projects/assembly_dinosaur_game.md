I designed and built a preliminary version of a game inspired by the chrome dinosaur game written in MIPS assembly. The entire game can be exported to 32-bit binary instructions that can be run on the single cycle cpu built in verilog as a part of another project.

The functionality the game holds is: 

- user jumps over cacti using the keyboard
- game ends if user comes into contact with cactus
- speed of cactus generation increases with play time

I created this game as an individual for a computer architecture class.
