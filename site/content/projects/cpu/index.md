I designed and implemented a MIPS compliant single cycle CPU. It used a 32-bit architecture. This CPU is capable of completing the following assembly commands:
- load word
- store word
- add
- add immediate
- subtract
- set less than
- xor immediate
- jump register
- jump and link
- jump
- branch equal
- branch not equal

I worked on this project individually over the course of 2 weeks as a part of the computer architecture class.
