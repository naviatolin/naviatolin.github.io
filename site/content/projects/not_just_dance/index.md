A partner and I created a game where a user completes certain dance moves after we show them what to complete, and we score them on how well they dance and check if they are dancing the correct move. This algorithm uses:
- accelerometer data
- FFT
- cross correlation
- signal aligning techniques

To read more about the algorithm and how the game works, click the link to the left.
