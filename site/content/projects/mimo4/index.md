I implemented two receivers for a 4x4 MIMO system. 
- The system knows the channel properties
- The system does not know the channel properties. 

The two receivers I implemented are the: MMSE decoder and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algrithm in MATLAB. These systems were done in simulation with a provided simulated channel.
