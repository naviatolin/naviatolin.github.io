Huber et al. propose a new digital beam-forming radar concept and a new digital signal processing approach in the paper “A Novel Digital Beam-Forming Concept for Spaceborne Reflector SAR Systems”. They propose new sensor architecture in the form of a reflector and a digital feed array where historically planar phased antenna array systems were used for spaceborn SAR. They also propose a new digital signal processing technique using the signal properties of the transmitted waveform. 
This paper will review their contributions while providing additional background required to understand the paper following the Stanford EE 258 class. Additionally, the methodology to reproduce portions of their results is covered and discussed.
