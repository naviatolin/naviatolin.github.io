In this paper, we leveraged introductory-level skills in analog-digital communication (ADC) to design an end-to-end communication system in Simulink. The Simulink model of the system was used to then select appropriate physical components and understand a potential hardware implementation. The ADC system model was designed to use Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) as the modulation scheme and optimized to fit within a handful of real-world constraints including power limitations, transmission rate, error rate, and availability of components for the hardware implementation. The final result of the Simulink model demonstrated the capability for a transmitter and receiver to send digital messages to one another utilizing a custom packet encoding scheme.

This project served as an excellent demonstration of introductory ADC skills and helped better inform and relate these skills to real-world system design.
