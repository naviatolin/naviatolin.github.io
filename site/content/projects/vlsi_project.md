As a part of my discrete math class, a project partner and I conducted research into how VLSI circuits can be optimized using Euler paths. We looked into how to represent MOS transistor circuits as logic graphs. We also designed an algorithm to simplify logic graphs that are excessively complicated which can then be turned into electrical layouts in silicon.
