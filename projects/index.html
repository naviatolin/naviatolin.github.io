<p>We ran tests for different logic gates and optimized the multiplicities of the nMOS and pMOS transistors to ensure that the constructed logic gates were outputting strong logical highs and strong logical lows.</p>
<p>From these logic gates, we then constructed a 1-bit full adder, a 4-bit full adder, and then a 4-bit multiplier. We measured the voltage transfer characteristics at all the steps and propogation delays in order to calculate the fastest clock speed possible for the system. We were able to visually show how long it takes each final bit of the output of the multiplier to turn.</p>

We provided the algorithm with a huge training data set (several gigabytes) and took photos of ourselves spelling out the letters of the alphabet. So far, the program allows the user to type in a word, the algorithm picks (at random) one of the test images for each letter we took of ourselves, and outputs what word it is that it thinks we are spelling. In the future, the algorithm could be improved by allowing the user to input letters using the camera.</p>
<p>The algorithm used:</p>

<li>singular value decomposition</li>
<li>principal component analysis</li>

<p>The functionality the game holds is:</p>
<ul>
<li>user jumps over cacti using the keyboard</li>
<li>game ends if user comes into contact with cactus</li>
<li>speed of cactus generation increases with play time</li>
</ul>
<p>I created this game as an individual for a computer architecture class.</p>

                                    <div class = "content"> <p>I worked with safe consumption site advocates in the Boston area to design a tool that could potentially revolutionize the current state of safe consumption sites in the U.S. today. This project was done in a team of four and over a semester through a user oriented collaborative design class.</p>
<p>The severity of the opioid epidemic today was shocking to see and we all really wanted to do something about it. All the research and anecdotal evidence pointed to safe consumption sites where unadultered drugs can be administered safely to users. We decided against talking to the actual users of safe consumption sites as that would be unethical and create a power imbalance.</p>
<p>Through conducting user interviews, and spending a lot of time figuring out the pain points of safe consumption site advocates, we were able to really understand the current issues as to why safe consumption sites did not exist today, and what we could do to change that. We even became trained to administer NARCAN!</p>
<p>A main focus of this project was to understand how tools like codesign, and user interviews are so important to designing a final product that people would actually need and use.

There is a powerpoint that demonstrates two of our sprints and what our final product design was.</p>

Olin likes to use the term &ldquo;overscoping your life&rdquo; to describe this phenomenon. This application aims to help people avoid this by  using the premise that people are actually more likely to be productive when they take breaks and complete activities that make themselves happy. This is backed by numerous productivity studies.</p>
<p>The functionality this app holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>a personalized planner to input calendar events and tasks</li>
<li>breaks down tasks (given an estimated time) into manegeable chunks</li>
<li>automated scheduling of work periods into your work day</li>
<li>no scheduling of work during desired rest periods</li>
<li>scheduled breaks in between work periods and events</li>
<li>prioritization of self-care activities when necessary</li>
<li>in the future: take user input to modify work period lengths and suggest necessary self care activities from user data</li>
</ul>
<p>This was completed as a part of a two person team for a software design class. My contributions to the project was the algorithm writing and backend programming for the application. My partner's contributions were the front end programming and UI development.</p>

                                    <div class = "content"> <p>As a part of my discrete math class, a project partner and I conducted research into how VLSI circuits can be optimized using Euler paths. We looked into how to represent MOS transistor circuits as logic graphs. We also designed an algorithm to simplify logic graphs that are excessively complicated which can then be turned into electrical layouts in silicon.</p>
