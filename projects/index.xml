      <description>I implemented two receivers for a 4x4 MIMO system.
 The system knows the channel properties The system does not know the channel properties.  The two receivers I implemented are the: MMSE decoder and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algrithm in MATLAB. These systems were done in simulation with a provided simulated channel.

      <title>Complete Communications System Modeling Using BPSK</title>
      <link>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/bpsk/</link>

      <description>I leveraged introductory-level skills in analog-digital communication (ADC) to design an end-to-end communication system in Simulink. The Simulink model of the system was used to then select appropriate physical components and understand a potential hardware implementation. The ADC system model was designed to use Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) as the modulation scheme and optimized to fit within a handful of real-world constraints including power limitations, transmission rate, error rate, and availability of components for the hardware implementation.</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/microcontrollers/</guid>
      <description>With the rising popularity of lifestyle video games and lack of game consoles on the market during this pandemic, I created a USB powered game controller that could interface with the popular game: Stardew Valley. This project was made as a part of a project-based microcontrollers class offered in the fall of 2020. This was a semester long class where I exercised and grew my skills in KiCAD to iteratively design schematics, layout PCBs, electrical and firmware system design, and part sourcing.</description>

      <title>Analog Multiplier</title>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/analog_multiplier/</guid>
      <description>I designed and implemented a 4-bit multiplier using CMOS transistors in LTSpice. As a part of this project, tests for different logic gates and the multiplicities of the nMOS and pMOS transistors were optimized to ensure that the gates were outputting strong logical highs and lows.
These logic gates were used to construct a 1-bit full adder, a 4-bit full adder, and then a 4-bit multiplier. The voltage transfer characteristics and propogation delays at each step were calculated to estimate the fastest clock speed possible for the system.</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/uocd/</guid>
      <description>I worked with safe consumption site advocates in the Boston area to design a tool that could potentially revolutionize the current state of safe consumption sites in the U.S. today. This project was done in a team of four and over a semester through a user oriented collaborative design class.
The severity of the opioid epidemic today was shocking to see and we all really wanted to do something about it.</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/cpu/</guid>
      <description>I designed and implemented a MIPS compliant single cycle CPU. It used a 32-bit architecture. This CPU is capable of completing the following assembly commands:
 load word store word add add immediate subtract set less than xor immediate jump register jump and link jump branch equal branch not equal  I worked on this project individually over the course of 2 weeks as a part of the computer architecture class.</description>

      <description>As a part of a principles of engineering class, I built a small, personable robot that wandered the halls of Olin College&#39;s academic center and said hi to people. This was done as a part of a 4 person team over half a semester. My personal contributions were firmware, and programming how the robot would react to its surroundings. I also used agile scrum to serve as the project planner (Full Paper)</description>

      <description>Many college students and people in the workforce are pushing themselves in this never ending rat race which can be a huge detriment to their mental health. Olin likes to use the term &amp;ldquo;overscoping your life&amp;rdquo; to describe this phenomenon. This application aims to help people avoid this by using the premise that people are actually more likely to be productive when they take breaks and complete activities that make themselves happy.</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/vlsi_optimization/</guid>
      <description>I looked into how to represent MOS transistor circuits as logic graphs and implemented an algorithm to simplify these logic graphs. This allows the MOS transistor layouts in silicon to be optimized. (Full Paper)</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/assembly_chrome_dinosaur/</guid>
      <description>I designed and built a preliminary version of a game inspired by the chrome dinosaur game written in MIPS assembly. The entire game can be exported to 32-bit binary instructions that can be run on the single cycle cpu built in verilog as a part of another project.
The functionality the game holds is:
 user jumps over cacti using the keyboard game ends if user comes into contact with cactus speed of cactus generation increases with play time  (Full Paper)</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/twitter_scraping/</guid>
      <description>As there were many presedential candidates in the beginning of the 2020 presidential election, it was hard to keep up with what everyone was saying and what everyone stood for individually. Acknowledging that twitter had become the most common form of political communication directly from candidates, I gathered tweets and picked out the words that were most associated with each candidate.

      <description>A partner and I created a game where a user completes certain dance moves after we show them what to complete, and we score them on how well they dance and check if they are dancing the correct move. This algorithm uses:
 accelerometer data FFT cross correlation signal aligning techniques  To read more about the algorithm and how the game works, click the link to the left.

      <description>As a part of my topics in bioengineering class, I took a deep dive into problems with EEG based brain computer interfaces. A huge issue is the artifacts that are created and lower than ideal spatial resolution. I researched ICA, CSP, and other spatial filters. (Full Paper)</description>

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/differential_drive/</guid>
      <description>I used the concept of differential drive to command a NEATO across a bridge that can be defined by a parametric curve function. I used ROS in order to send velocity commands to the NEATOs.

      <guid>http://pranavi-boyalakuntla.com/projects/boats/</guid>
      <description>I designed a mathematically defined boat to calculate its angle of vanishing stability. This project involved CAD for designing the physical ribs of the boats, laser cutting, shrink wrapping, and mechanical testing. All calculations were done in mathematica and CAD models were created using SolidWorks. (Full Paper)</description>

      <description>I implemented SVD and PCA to translate sign language letters using a large training data set. The algorithm was written to allow the user to type in a word. Then, it picks a random image of each letter, translates those images, and outputs the final word. (Full Paper)</description>
