Designed and implemented a 4-bit multiplier using CMOS transistors in LTSpice.

We ran tests for different logic gates and optimized the multiplicities of the nMOS and pMOS transistors to ensure that the constructed logic gates were outputting strong logical highs and strong logical lows. 

From these logic gates, we then constructed a 1-bit full adder, a 4-bit full adder, and then a 4-bit multiplier. We measured the voltage transfer characteristics at all the steps and propogation delays in order to calculate the fastest clock speed possible for the system. We were able to visually show how long it takes each final bit of the output of the multiplier to turn.

This project was done as a part of a two person team for a circuits class.
