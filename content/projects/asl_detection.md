A partner and I used a classic facial recognition algorithm we implemented from researchh papers to translate American Sign Language. We provided the algorithm with a huge training data set (several gigabytes) and took photos of ourselves spelling out the letters of the alphabet. So far, the program allows the user to type in a word, the algorithm picks (at random) one of the test images for each letter we took of ourselves, and outputs what word it is that it thinks we are spelling. In the future, the algorithm could be improved by allowing the user to input letters using the camera.

The algorithm used:
- singular value decomposition
- principal component analysis
